# Christmas 2021 React Native


## Introduction
While I am in France I thought that I'd have a go at creating a React Native App.

I have with me an Android Phone, and an Apple iPad so that's a good couple of devices that I can use as my target devices.

## Plan

Learn about React Native while building an application that I would find useful.

I love France and learning about the country. I love travelling around.

But what to make?

Something with geolocation so I would know which departement I am in, with relevant information about that departement.
 - Food
 - Statistics about the size, number of residents
 - Some kind of tracking as to where I have been (keeping track in a DB, taken even if the app is not being used)
 - I love the idea of recording things without having to record things. What things can I record? Sound? Light levels? Position, heading, speed? Noise level? Battery levels? All of this could be stored in a DB.
 - How would it be possible to record locally but upload the data only when there is access to wifi (for example).
 - A map of France, with a dot showing where I currently am
 - This map would show the current departement.
